# Put your assumptions here

I started by reading the challenge and understanding what the starting point and
expected outputs would be.
I was a little confused because at the beginning of the challenge he talked about a
specific path and, in the sequence, he talked about different categories and different
paths until he reached the expected output.

I tried to follow the path of capturing all the arts available on the site in their 
most different ways, taking care with the navigation between the next pages and 
subcategories.

I created some functions to make sure I was getting to the correct page, with 
the specific information needed to be able to capture the output data.

I had to deal with some problems and difficulties with this approach, I had to do some tries until I got the result I wanted.

After ensuring that I was on the correct outputs page, then it was just scraping 
and cleaning the data, creating specific functions when necessary.
