# Feedback

We're always looking for ways to improve our hiring and trial system,
to get a good balance of challenge and minimal time and frustration.

We'd love some feedback from you on your experience of the trial project.

## Time and Trial Length

> How did you feel about the length of the trial?
--- It was good, I found myself into trouble since I dont read the specific wanted paths

> Was it too much, or too quick for the effort involved?
--- --- I believe it's normal, from what I've been doing. Again, I tried to scrape the whole website, so it put me into some trouble.


## Complexity or Difficulty

> Did you find the difficulty appropriate?
Yes, I believe this challenge cover the knowledge needed for a data scraping job.

> Was the trial too easy, too difficult, or just right for the position.
--- I believe it's just right, but things can became more difficult when you need to solve captcha, rotate proxy, render javascript thigs.

> you feel you are applying for?
--- Yes, for sure, I'm glad with myself that I accomplished to deliver this challenge, I'am also glad with my results.

> (Your answer here is _not_ used to judge you as a candidate, only to improve our trial process)
--- It's all good, I'm glad to help.

## Any Other Thoughts?

--- First I had some trouble with the env configuration, I'm currently using WSL2.
--- I needed to create a new env and install pyopenssl and cryptography-38.0.4 (downgrating from 39.0.0)
--- I always like to have a expected output to work with. Some expected values with the right format, I think adding one expected output would help a lot for new candidates.
--- I have to congratulate you guys for Scrapy Cloud, I thought it was going to be difficult to setup, but it was pretty easy and simple! I'm amazed with it.

## Thanks!
